    All About Me
  </head>
  <p> Hello! My name is Ian Modina and I am currently a sophomore at Whitney High School. My interests are basketball, volleyball, travelling, photography, and music. A fun fact is that I have been to 13 countries -- United States of America, Mexico, Iceland, Philippines, France, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Belgium, Netherlands, Brazil, and Argentina.</p>

  <p> I have been playing basketball for basically my whole life. I've played in recreational city leagues, club teams, and AAU teams. The Los Angeles Lakers are my favorite team and I love LeBron James. </p>

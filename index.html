  <p> I have been playing basketball for basically my whole life. I've played in recreational city leagues, club teams, and AAU teams, and currently Whitney's basketball team. The Los Angeles Lakers are my favorite team and I love LeBron James. For volleyball, I started in middle school and am playing for Whitney's volleyball team.</p>
  <p> I have been to 13 countries -- United States of America, Mexico, Iceland, Canada, Philippines, France, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Belgium, Netherlands, Brazil, and Argentina. My favorite places are Mount Kirkjufell, Bruarfross, and Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach in Iceland, Lake Louise in Canada, El Nido in the Philippines, Mount Fuji and Tokyo in Japan, Rio de Jainero in Brazil, and Iguazu Falls in Brazil/Argentina.</p>

    <u>Overview</u>
  </h1>
  <p> Hello! My name is Ian Modina and I am currently a sophomore at Whitney High School. My interests are basketball, volleyball, traveling, photography, and music. </p>

  <p> I have been playing basketball for basically my whole life. I've played in recreational city leagues, club teams, and AAU teams, and currently Whitney's basketball team. The Los Angeles Lakers are my favorite team and I love LeBron James. For volleyball, I started in middle school and am playing for Whitney's volleyball team.</p>
  <p> I have been to 13 countries -- United States of America, Mexico, Iceland, Canada, Philippines, France, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Belgium, Netherlands, Brazil, and Argentina. </p>
  <p> I have two cameras, a Lumix GX100 and Insta360 X3. I'm relatively new on how to operate the cameras, with my only knowledge is about taking pictures/videos, exporting, and changing the contrast. However, I've used these cameras on my trip to Japan, Lake Tahoe, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Brazil, and Argentina. </p>
  <p> My favorite music genre is R&B, and I'm currently collecting vinyls for my record player.  </p>
